      <description>I notice some colleagues working with “transcript count” RNAseq data. Interestingly, these “transcript count” are not integers. However, these “transcript count” data were treated as regular count data and still used as input for differential expression analysis tool such as deseq2.
More interestingly, when I asked “what is transcript count?” the answer I got is always “it is UMI count with some sophisticated statistical transformation.” Although this answer does not contain details, it is clear that “transcript count” is based on UMI count.</description>

      <description>This is my first-ever blog post. For the purpose of network reverse-engineering, I need to work with my powerful workstation at the university campus. Since I am working from home, I need to do that remotely. Furthermore, since the programs that I need for network reverse-engineering are Bioconductor packages, I also need to install these packages beforehand. I am a disciplined R programmer. I always use renv to manage packages for each project individually.</description>
