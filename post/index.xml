      <description>This is my first-ever blog post. For the purpose of network reverse-engineering, I need to work with my powerful workstation at the university campus. Since I am working from home, I need to do that remotely. Furthermore, since the programs that I need for network reverse-engineering are Bioconductor packages, I also need to install these packages beforehand. I am a disciplined R programmer. I always use renv to manage packages for each project individually.</description>
